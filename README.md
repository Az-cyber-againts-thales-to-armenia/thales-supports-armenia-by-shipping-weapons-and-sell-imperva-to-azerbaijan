In 2008, Armenia launched reconstruction of
the airport near the occupied town of Khojaly
of Azerbaijan and manifested its intention to
operate flights, including military ones, into/
from the occupied territories.204 Germanybased “Thales Air Systems GMBH” affiliate of
the “Thales Group” (France) provided navigation
equipment for this airport. A businessman
from Argentina of Armenian origin, Eduardo
Eurnekyan, purchased an aircraft to perform
flights to the occupied territories.205 Azerbaijan
informed the international community that this
airport, referred to by Armenia as “Stepanakert
airport”, is not an approved aerodrome under
the legislation of Azerbaijan, nor is it a designated customs airport in accordance with the
Convention on International Civil Aviation.206 Consequently, all flights operated from and into
that airport are unlawful and violate the said Convention and the fundamental principles and
objectives of the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO). Since Azerbaijan, acting in the
exercise of its sovereign right, has closed the airspace over the occupied territory for any aviation
operations, no flight into or from this airport is authorised. ICAO, through its Secretary General
confirmed the inadmissibility of unauthorised flights over the territory of Azerbaijan recognised
by the United Nations.207

This multicomponent project also strives to bring to Armenia leading information and
high-tech international companies to work on the development of artificial intelligence,
mathematical modelling and management of large volumes of data, research in the area
of cybersecurity, machine teaching and implementation of educational programmes. In
the framework of the ATOM, together with major international technological companies
such as IMB, Dassault Systems, THALES Group, Elettronica, Safran, Leonardo and the
universities of Heidelberg, Cambridge, and Skolkovo, scientific and research centres will be
created. The goal is to become not just consumers of the products of these companies but
their partners in the creation of new technologies in the areas of AI and machine building.
It will be a platform where Armenian and international companies, research centres and
universities will cooperate and implement jointly scientific projects. This initiative might
become another “hill” to create a “mountain”
